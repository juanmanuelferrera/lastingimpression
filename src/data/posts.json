So when I first moved into the ashram and I started reading Radhanath Swami’s The Journey Home almost right away (like most new bhaktas these days it seems) I noticed that Radhanath Swami was praising various bogus gurus and yogis. I found this to be somewhat perplexing as Srila Prabhupada strongly criticized these types of people all throughout his books. I don’t remember asking anybody about this apparent contradiction between what Radhanath Swami was saying about these people and what Prabhupada says about these types of people, however I somehow or other came to the standard Iskcon approved understanding that The Journey Home is a preaching/introductory book and that Radhanath Swami’s intention when praising these pseudo-spiritualists is just to attract people to Krishna without upsetting them with strong criticism.</p>\n<p> <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"../../../20190105190552/https%253A/lastingimpression.info/the-journey-to-kumbhipaka/index.html#more-3478\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading The Journey to Kumbhipaka\">(more…)</span></a></p>\n</div>",

You can join this yoga system and give me money. I shall give you mantra, and you become God.” <strong>Be careful of these dogs.</strong> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180324231657/https://vanisource.org/wiki/750811_-_Lecture_SB_06.01.55_-_Paris\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SB 6.1.55, Praris, Aug 11 1975</a>)\n</p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n</div>",
